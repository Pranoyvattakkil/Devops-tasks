Method of mobaxtrem to access linux

install>settings>configuration>terminal(Paste using right click[check],display scrollbar[check]),SSH(ssh keep alive[]),Misc(home tab is replaced when starting new tab[], Toolbar(move save)


In aws, select instance and click on connect, ssh client(select the user name)

In mobaxtrem, session>new session>ssh>go to advanced ssh setttings>use private key and browse for the pem file

______________________________________________

For MAC users

Open terminal>cd to downloads>run the command,chmod 400 linux1.pem(whatever is u r per file)

Now go to linux instance in aws>ssh client>copy that example user name details completely and paste it on the terminal.

Linux advantages :
1)open source
2)Secure
       A)Hacker(hacking linux is difficult)
        B)Virus(if a package downloaded from internet with virus,its designed like virus will be confined to particular file or folder here you installed. So just remove the folder/file this will help to free of virus)
3)Need less resources(linux is with only cli whereas windows with cli and gui)
4)multi user and multi tasking(multiple user accounts can be created and they can do whatever they want. in windows creating user accounts is limited)

Architecture of Linux

In windows
User > shell(on top extra layer-GUI) > OS > H/W
In linux
user>shell>kernal>H/W

File system hierarchy

In Windows,we called folder,Administrator,OS, Software ,\, whereas in Linux we call directory, root user,Kernal,Package,/

/ in linux is top level root directory where as in windows its c drive

Root - home of root user


Home - home directory of other user

Boot - bootable files(OS related files)

Etc - contains all configurations(each and every details of the system)

Usr - contains all softwares

Bin - contains all the commands executed by user and root(like they preconfigured the commands)

Sbin - Contains commands executed by root

Sept 5

Sudo su -     - you will become root user

Ctrl + L        - to clear the terminal

4 steps to create a file in linux

1. Cat
2. Touch
3. Nano
4. Vi/Vim

Linux commands must be in lower case, they are case sensitive

Cat
cat > file1(file name) then add your content , then press enter
To exit from from here use ctrl + D
To add. Contents to file1 then execute, cat >> file1 and press enter then exit it by using ctrl + D

To view the content of the file by cat file1

ls      - to list the file/dir

Touch
Cmd : touch file2 to create empty file

Nano
Cmd : nano file3 to create file
To exit use ctrl + x, it will ask if you need to save the file then press Y(capital Y)

Vi/Vim

Cmd : vi file4, then press i(small letter i) to insert
To save and quit esc :wq! Then press enter

By using touch you can create empty file, by using nano and vi to edit the content, by using cat you can override and add the data but you can’t edit the data

To create directory

Cmd : mkdir dir1

Cmd : ls -l      long list(it will give all details about file and directory. When u see d the its directory hen you see - the its file)

Purpose of hidden files - its to protect the files from you(OS related files it should not be deleted by mistake). When you put .(dot) infant of file or dir before creating it then this file will become hidden

Cmd: ls -a to show all files including hidden files
Cmd: ls -la long list of all items including hidden items

Sept-6

Cmd: mkdir -p dira/dirb/dirc (it will create directory c inside the b directory and which will be inside the a directory) and here p means parent

In linux single . (Dot) represents current directory and double . (Dot) represents previous directory.

cd dira/dirb/dirc - if you wants to go to dirc in one step
cd ../../.. - if you want to go back to the first directory

cmd: pwd - print working directory

cp - to copy the command
Syntax : cp source destination
Eg : cp file1 dir1
If you’re copying directory then
Eg: cp -r dir2 dir3

mv - to move a directory or a file/to rename it

mv file1c dir1

If you want to rename it then

mv file2c dir1/file3c


Tree - to know the hierarchy of the file system
Install package by yum install tree -y

Path

Always understand the path that you’re working. No need to cd into the directory/file if you need to work on it

/ - top level root directory(represented with . In tree)
Root - home directory of root user
Home - home directory of other user

Sept 8

cmd: touch ../file1 - it will create a file in your previous directory because of that double .(dot)

~ - home directory, house of other user
/ - house of root directory

Cmd : rm -rf /tmp/* - it will delete all files in tmp directory(* is to select all files)

Tab key is used for autocomplete also if the particular file is there in the particular location

Copy - highlight paste - right click

Cmd : ctrl + c - it will not execute the previous command, it will abort it

Grep - global regular expression pin (to search for particular word)
Eg : cmd : grep root /etc/passwd

Less/more - this will show the content inside the file but cat is preferred

Cmd : head -3 /etc/passwd - first 3 lines will show
Cmd : tail /etc/passwd - last 10 lines will show

Sort
Cmd : sort test file  - entire data will be sorted and it will not modify the existing content

Sept 9

Cmd : hostname  it will give you the DNS name
Cmd : hostname -i it will give private ip
Cmd : ifconfig it will also show ip address
Cmd : cat /etc/os-release it will give the details of the OS

* - wild card character or all (you can add this to the end of the command or before, so this star will give all the details if you don’t know it)
Cmd: cat hello* (the it will open the hello file automatically)


Yum - to deal with packages and updates

Cmd : yum install httpd -y
Cmd : yum update httpd -y
Cmd : yum remove httpd -y
Cmd : yum list installed - this will show the list of packages installed with version number
Cmd : yum list installed | grep httpd*
|   - pipe is used to combine 2 commands

Cmd : which httpd
Cmd: which tree
Cmd : which git

With “which" command we can get know if package is there

Cmd : service httpd start
Cmd: service httpd status
Cmd : service httpd stop
Cmd : service https status
Cmd : service httpd reload - whenever you have updated the package then use this command

Systemctl or service commands(the service commands above can be changed to systemctl as its the new approach)even though if you're running service command it will work as systemctl commands only

Cmd : systemctl start httpd
Cmd: systemctl status httpd

Cmd : chkconfig httpd on  or chkconfig httpd off- it will automatically update the package once installed, unlike manually updating (using reload command) everytime. New alternative command for this is 
Cmd : systemctl enable httpd or systemctl disable httpd

Find command
Cmd : find -type f (f means file, it will show all files in including hidden files in the current directory)
Cmd : find -type d - to show all the directory
Cmd : find / -type f -name os-release (this will search and find os-release file inside /)
Cmd : find / -type f -name passwd (like find the file inside root directory and its name will be passwd)
Cmd : cd - this command will help you to comeback to home

How to create user

Cmd : useradd raj
Cmd: cat /etc/passwd - it will show list of users
Cmd : groupadd devops
Cmd : cat /etc/group

When you create a user , with the same name a group will be created and this user will be part of it. Vice versa won’t happen

So here we will be creating 10 users and adding in to a group then assigning permission to the group so it will cascade to all users inside the group

Cmd : gpasswd -a raj devops (a for add)
Suppose I want to add 10 users here then
Cmd : gpasswd -M raj,sai,hari,krish,lal,pl,bal,ot,ty,wo devops (M for multiple)
Suppose is I want to remove any
Cmd : gpasswd -d raj devops - (d for delete)

Softlink and hardlink

In windows we call shortcut and in linux we call it as softlink
Cmd : cd /var/www/html
Cmd: touch index.html
Cmd:cat index.html
Cmd : Cd
Cmd : ln -s /var/www/html/index.html softindex (ln is for link and s is for soft)
Cmd : ls
Cmd : ls -l

U can add data in soft index but indirectly it keeps in index.html file

Cmd : vi softindex

So when u delete softindex then there won’t be any issue with index.html(because its act like a shortcut) but when you delete index.html then whole file will be affected and softlink will become broken.

Hardlink :
This will be like whatever is the content in the original location, this will be present in the same shortcut location as well. Like its complete backup
So if u delete original file/hardlink file it will not affect the other.
Softlink is a shortcut and hardlink is a backup

Cmd : ln /var/www/html/index.html hardindex

Cmd : cat  >  hard index
Mygoogle and ctrl +d(to exit)

Cmd : cat  >>  /var/www/html/index.html
Pranoydemy and ctrl +d(to exit)

Sept 12

Zip is actually a file, when you apply zip to a directory then it will become file(check the zip file using ls -l command)

Zip is used to reduce the size of your document

Tar and gz

Tar - used to pack
Gz- used to compress

Cmd : tar -cvf dira.tar dira (c - create v - verbose to show live output and f - forcefully) you should provide output ie, .tar file in the command
Cmd : gzip dira.tar - after this command it will become dira.tar.gz file
How to unzip the file
Cmd : gunzip dira.tar.gz
Cmd : tar -xvf dira.tar (x-extract, v-verbose,f-forcefully)
To do this in one command
Cmd : tar -cvzf dira.tar.gz dira (giving tar and zip in one line)
Cmd : tar -xvzf dira.tar.gz (giving untar and unzip in one line)

Redhat - Amazone linux, rhel, centos they are using yum to install the package
Debian - ubuntu using apt to install the package

How files are getting in linux?
Some packages will be in redhat repository by default, from where you can directly install without downloading
Some packages are in internet and requires download first and then install eg : Jenkins

To install - yum is used as the command
To download from internet -  wget is used as the command

Java is prerequisite to install Jenkins
Cmd : wget -o and rest of command from jenkins.io  this helps to download jenkin package
Cmd : yum install Java*-y
Cmd : yum install jenkins -y

Permissions

File will be 0 bytes initially
Directory will be 6 bytes

When you create file 1 hardlink will be created
When you create directory 2 hardlink will be created

R- read - 4- opening
W-write - 2- you can delete, edit
X-execute - 1- you can install or just running

First set of perm - belong to Owner
Second set of perm - belong to owners group members
Third set of perm - all other users

A directory will be having 755 permission by default
A file will be having 644 permission by default

Symbolic method and absolute number

Cmd : chown - to change owner
Cmd chgrp - to change owners group
Cmd : chmod - to change permission

Cmd : chmod 777 dirb     - u r giving full permissions
Cmd : chown raj dira

Cmd : tail -5 /etc/passwd. - to check if there is a user called raj, if not create new 

Cmd : useradd raj

Sept-13

Permissions
For file 
R - u can open
W-u can edit the content
X-run

For directory
R-you can perform ls
W-add,del/rename
X-you can cd into that directory

Rm -rf  *- to remove unwanted things

How to set password to any user 

Cmd : tail -3 /etc/passwd so it will give raj as existing user
Cmd : passwd raj

Now we are going to login as raj user, for that root user need to do the following
Cmd : vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Scroll down, then you have to change the line PasswordAuthentication No, to Password Authentication yes
Then you have to restart the sshd service
Cmd : service sshd reload

How to open terminal for other user in mobaxterm

Now in mobaxterm > click on session> new session>ssh>enter user name as raj@dns name from ec2 instance>ok then enter the password created

If u run sudo su - then it will not help you to switch to root user, because normal users are not allowed to become root user. Only ec2-user can do that

to login as new user in linux
cmd : ssh -i "Paru.pem" raj@ec2-52-13-11-42.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
then you have to enter the password

How root user can control other user permissions?
In root,
Cmd : cd temp

Cmd : touch file1
Cmd : chmod 644 file1
This will give read access to raj user(last 4 represent that)

In raj,
Cmd : cat file1, this will work because raj has read access
Cmd : cat > file1 it will not work because he dosent have write permission.

for directory
In root,
Cmd : cd temp
Cmd : mkdire dir1
Cmd ls -l
Cmd : chmod 750 dir1

In raj,
Cmd : cd temp
Cmd : cd dir1 , it won’t work
Cmd : ls dir1 , it won’t work, because we revoked permission
